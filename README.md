# Tutorial: Tour of Heroes

The Tour of Heroes tutorial covers the fundamentals of Angular.
This is an app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. This basic app has many of the features in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

Through this tutorial, we have learned::

- Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
- Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
- Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
- Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
- Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
- Enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view.
- Format data with pipes.
- Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.
- Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.
- enough Angular to get started and gain confidence that Angular can do whatever we need it to do.

After completing all tutorial steps, the final app will look like this [live example](https://run.stackblitz.com/api/angular/v1).
